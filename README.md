# basic_auth

### Build
Start a terminal instance in the root directory of the project and type make to build the executable.
Run the program by typing "./main.exe"
Or build and run the program with the line "make; ./main.exe"
### Usage
The program asks the user whether they want to login or register then asks the user to enter a username and a password.
  -To login enter 1 and to register enter 2.
Program checks if there is an existing database (I say database but it's just a .dat file.) and if there's none, it creates one and exits.
If there is an already existing database, program performs necessary authentication operations.

## Attention
  This program is not suited for real world usage. It's simply a practice project.
